Currently, I am an Assistant Professor (Research) at the Division of Applied Mathematics, Brown University, USA. My research is centered around scientific machine learning with a main focus on developing efficient machine learning approaches for solving high-dimensional physics-based systems in the domains of computational mechanics and biomechanics. My research is generously supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).

- I have been a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Division of [Applied Mathematics](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/home), at Brown University, where I was advised by [Prof. George Karniadakis](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis). 

- I completed my Ph.D. in 2020 at [Bauhaus University, Germany](https://www.uni-weimar.de/en/university/start/) under the supervision of [Prof. Timon Rabczuk](https://www.uni-weimar.de/en/civil-engineering/institute/ism/team/professors/prof-dr-ing-timon-rabczuk/). My Ph.D. thesis is titled "Phase field based modeling of fracture with isogeometric analysis and machine learning methods".

- Here is a recent copy of my [CV](https://somdattagoswami.github.io/files/Resume.pdf).

- My research interests are on scientific machine learning and its applications on computational mechanics and biomechanics. In particular, I have been actively involved in the design of learning machines that leverage the underlying physical laws and/or governing equations to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments.
